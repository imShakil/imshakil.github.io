### What is slack?

Slack is a single workplace for messaging, file sharing between team members. It’s designed to support the collaboration with people online as efficiently as we do face-to-face. Slack can be divided mainly into four parts.

1.  Slack workspace name
2.  A number of channels
3.  A number of peoples
4.  Messaging window

To use slack, we have to choose a unique workspace name, this name generates a unique URL to visit the workspace. In the following picture, EduHubICT as the workspace name, and its URL is: [eduhubict.slack.com](https://eduhubict.slack.com)

In slack, teamwork, and communications happen in channels. A channel is a single place for a team to share messages, files, and tools. A channel can be public or private. Private channels can be seen only for invited/ joined members.

In the workspace, we can add people to join the team using their email.

### Features of slack

Slack is an instant messaging system. Besides messaging, slack supports audio-video call and screen sharing to show screen exactly between teammates. It also supports drawing on-screen while sharing with teammates.

Slack supports a lot of apps to connect with the workspace. Those connected apps make it easier to collaborate with teams.
