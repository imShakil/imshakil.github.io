## Introduction

In todayâ€™s cloud-native world, managing containers at scale is a challenge. Kubernetes (K8s) has emerged as the go-to solution for orchestrating containerized applications. Whether youâ€™re a developer, DevOps engineer, or system administrator, understanding Kubernetes is essential for deploying and managing modern applications efficiently.

This guide will cover the fundamental concepts of Kubernetes and provide basic commands to get you started.

## Understanding Kubernetes Architecture

### Nodes

Kubernetes operates on a cluster of machines known as nodes. There are two types:

- Master Node: The brain of the cluster, responsible for scheduling workloads, maintaining the cluster state, and handling API requests.

- Worker Nodes: Execute the workloads and run containerized applications.

### Pods

A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. Each pod can contain one or more containers that share storage, networking, and resources.

### Deployments

A Deployment manages a set of pods and ensures that the desired number of replicas are running. It allows for easy updates and rollbacks.

### Services

Services provide networking and load balancing to pods. Types of services include:

- ClusterIP (default): Internal access within the cluster.

- NodePort: Exposes the service on a static port on each node.

- LoadBalancer: Uses a cloud providerâ€™s load balancer to expose the service externally.

- Ingress: Manages external access using domain names and routes traffic to services.

### ConfigMaps & Secrets

ConfigMaps store non-sensitive configuration data, such as environment variables.

Secrets store sensitive data like API keys and passwords, ensuring security.

## Key Features of Kubernetes

- Self-Healing: Automatically restarts failed containers.

- Auto-Scaling: Adjusts replicas based on CPU/memory usage.

- Rolling Updates & Rollbacks: Enables seamless deployments without downtime.

- Service Discovery & Load Balancing: Built-in DNS ensures smooth networking.

- Resource Management: Controls CPU and memory usage per container.

## Essential Kubernetes Commands

Use these commands to interact with a Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
# View cluster information
kubectl cluster-info

# List nodes in the cluster
kubectl get nodes

# Deploy an application using an image
kubectl create deployment my-app --image=nginx

# Check deployments, pods, and services
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services

# Expose deployment as a service (NodePort)
kubectl expose deployment my-app --type=NodePort --port=80

# Scale the deployment to 3 replicas
kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=3

# Delete the deployment
kubectl delete deployment my-app
```

## Writing a Kubernetes Deployment YAML

Instead of using CLI commands, you can define a deployment using a YAML manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Apply this YAML file using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f my-app.yaml
```

## Conclusion

Kubernetes simplifies container orchestration, making application deployment more scalable and resilient. By mastering its core concepts, you can efficiently manage containerized workloads in production environments.
