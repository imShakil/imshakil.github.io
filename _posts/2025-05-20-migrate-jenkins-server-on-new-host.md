# Migrating Jenkins Container from One Host To Another

When you're managing CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins inside Docker containers, migration between servers can seem daunting. 
I recently had to move my Jenkins instance from one VPS to another, ensuring no loss of job configurations, plugins, or build history. 
Here's how I did it â€” cleanly, safely, and efficiently.

## Caution

- Identify the Jenkins version you are using, it should be the same image on the new host
- Both server should be able to communicate with each other usin SSH

## Identity Jenkins Home Directory

On your current server, find the volume used to persist jenkins data. If you are using bind mounts volume try to find the location using following command:

```shell
docker inspect jenkins-container-name | grep volume
```

of if using docker named volume:

```shell
docker volume ls
```

## Backup Jenkins Data

Before creating a backup, make sure jenkins server stopped to avoid incosistency:

```shell
docker stop jenkins-container-name
```

Archive the jenkins home data:

- For Bind Mount Volume:

  ```shell
  tar -czvf jenkins_backup.tar.gz /path/of/bind/mount
  ```

- For a named volume:

  ```shell
  docker run --rm -v jenkins_home:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine \
  tar czvf /backup/jenkins_backup.tar.gz -C /data .
  ```
  > Here, we have used a new container using `alpine` image to create a backup of `jenkins` docker volume. it will create a `jenkins_backup.tar.gz` file in your current directory.

## Transfer Data to New Server

Copy the backup file to new server using `scp`:

```shell
scp jenkins_backup.tar.gz user@new_host:/path/to/new_host
```

## Restore Data

You can extract data into a directory to use as bind mount or a docker volume. I recommend to use docker named volume it easy to handle persistence data. 

- To extract into a directory:

  ```shell
  mkdir -p /var/jenkins_home
  tar -xzvf jenkins_backup.tar.gz -C /var/jenkins_home
  chown -R 1000:1000 /var/jenkins_home
  ```

- To extract into a docker volume:

  ```shell
  # create docker volume
  docker volume create jenkins_home
  
  # extract data into this volume and fix file permissions
  docker run --rm -v jenkins_home:/data -v /directory_path/of/backup_file/:/backup alpine \
  sh -c "cd /data && tar xzvf /backup/jenkins_backup.tar.gz && chown -R 1000:1000 /data"
  ```

  > What's happening here?: docker creating a new alpine container using jenkins_home volume, and extracted backup data into that directory and modified the files permission.

## Run Jenkins on the New Host

Let's run the jenkins container on the new host with resorted data volume.

```shell
docker run -d --name jenkins -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

> If you are using bind mount, then replace the `jenkins_home` docker volume with your mount directory.

We are done. With a few careful steps and the power of Docker, migrating Jenkins becomes a repeatable and reliable process. 
Whether you're moving to a better host or rebuilding infrastructure, this technique ensures you're never locked into a single machine.
